      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm from Shenzhen, China, and share my home with two cat brothers and a cat sister. I now live in London for my studies. Outside of academics, I enjoy playing the violin, swimming, tennis - and I'm a keen player of video games, especially strategy ones such as <em>Civilization</em>, <em>Age of Empires</em>, and <em>Three Kingdoms</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        From February 2024 to September 2025, I took a long break from my studies after being diagnosed with tumours and undergoing four surgeries. I'm deeply grateful to be a survivor. This experience has taught me that, apart from being alive and well, everything else is small. It has shown me not to fear taking a pause and starting again — and to appreciate the simple moments of being healthy and happy. My passion for learning has not faded; if anything, the pause has given me a clearer sense of purpose and refreshed energy for what comes next.
