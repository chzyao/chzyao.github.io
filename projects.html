          <p class="project-description">
            My ongoing MEng thesis project addresses the vulnerability of large-scale time-dependent solvers to node failures that can cause complete computation loss. Traditional disk-based checkpointing creates severe I/O bottlenecks and energy inefficiencies at exascale, where millions of processes must synchronise.
          </p>

          <p class="project-description">
            I am developing RePLay, a minimally intrusive in-memory checkpointing library written in C that leverages Open MPI's User-level Fault Mitigation (ULFM) framework. The library provides lightweight resilience while reducing disk I/O overheads through "erasure-coding parity" and "process-duplication" schemes, enabling automatic data recovery without full application restarts.
          </p>

          <p class="project-description">
            RePLay transparently intercepts MPI communications to rebuild distributed data structures from prior message exchanges, supports dynamic communicator reconstruction, and provides a disk-based fallback when spare processes are exhausted.
          </p>

          <p class="project-description">
            Current work focuses on energy efficiency and scalability. We are testing the hypotheses that (1) in-memory schemes will consume less energy due to reduced I/O operations, (2) online recovery will achieve faster time-to-solution despite higher memory use, and (3) energy efficiency will scale more effectively with problem size for in-memory schemes.
          </p>

          <p class="project-description">
            The next phase will involve integrating RePLay with the Nektar++ CFD framework to evaluate runtime overhead, recovery performance, and energy-to-solution metrics. Current efforts are centred on developing the core checkpointing infrastructure, verifying fault recovery on small MPI test cases, and preparing the library for large-scale solver coupling.

            we worked on overcoming the spectral-bias limitation of conventional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which struggle to capture steep boundary layers in singularly perturbed PDEs (ùúÄ ‚â™ 1).
          </p>

          <p class="project-description">
            We developed a Two-Scale Neural Network architecture that embeds the small-scale parameter ùúÄ directly into the network inputs, enabling accurate resolution of multiscale features without relying on Fourier features or auxiliary equations.
          </p>

          <p class="project-description">
            I validated the model on one-dimensional test cases down to ùúÄ = 10‚Åª‚Åµ, successfully reproducing sharp transition layers that standard PINNs fail to capture. In a related exploratory study, I analysed information flow during training using Information-Bottleneck metrics, quantifying signal-to-noise behaviour in adaptive-weight and residual-attention mechanisms to study feature compression and generalisation.

            The Foldable Aeroshell Demonstrator builds on Imperial College‚Äôs HATHOR (‚ÄúHypersonic foldable Aeroshell for Thermal protection using Origami‚Äù) research programme. While traditional rigid heat shields like Soyuz and Starliner are limited by launcher fairing size, foldable aeroshells can be stowed during launch and deployed before atmospheric entry, enabling heavier payload delivery. Our group designed a miniaturised, free-flight demonstrator manufacturable and testable within a ¬£150 k budget.

            I was responsible for the design of the Command and Data Handling (C&DH) and Telemetry, Tracking & Command (TT&C) subsystems. My work focused on defining the onboard communication architecture, performing data-budget analysis, and implementing ground-station communication modelling in Simulink. I selected and integrated the SpaceWire bus and a real-time operating system with LEON processors to support reliable data transfer between payload and telemetry units. I also developed the telemetry packet structure, simulated transmission reliability under noise and delay, and validated communication performance across mission phases.

            This project followed the conceptual design of a 90-passenger regional jet and focused on the structural design and analysis of its primary airframe components ‚Äî wings, fuselage, and empennage ‚Äî under multiple load cases, including symmetric flight, One-engine-inoperative (OEI), and nose-off landing. Our team developed analytical models for shear, bending, and torsion, optimised component weight and stiffness, and evaluated composite versus metallic configurations for manufacturability and fatigue resistance.

            I was responsible for the fuselage structural design, including the sizing of skin, stringers, and frames under pressurisation and bending loads. My work involved deriving load distributions, performing buckling and stability checks using analytical and numerical methods, and conducting material selection and optimisation through CES EduPack (now known as Ansys Granta EduPack) and MATLAB.
